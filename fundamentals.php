<?php
echo "Hello "; // echo is used to display output. it is a language construct not function().
               // Language constructs are keywords that the PHP parser already knows about. Some language 
               // constructs act like functions, while others are used to build control statements such as 
               // if and while .

Echo "Anurag <br/>" ;      // it is a case insensitive, echo, ECHO, Echo, ECho all are same.
echo "Welcome"; echo "Anurag"; echo "Kashyap";  // multiple echo can be used in the same line.
// but output will be like: WelcomeAnuragKashyap
// if we want a line break after welcome then we can use <br/>.

echo "<br/> Welcome <br/>"; echo "Anurag <br/>"; echo "Kashyap";  // multiple echo can be use in same line.
