<?php

// A client (browser) sends an HTTP request to the server; then the server returns a response to the client. 
// The response contains the requested content.

// Various HTTP Methods:
// GET - used to request data from a specified resource
// POST - used to send data to a server to create/update a resource.
// PUT - used to update data on database.
// HEAD - identical to GET, but without the response body.
// DELETE - delete contents from database.
// PATCH - used to apply partial modifications to a resource.
// TRACE - used to perform a message loop-back test that tests the path for the target resource (useful for debugging purposes).
